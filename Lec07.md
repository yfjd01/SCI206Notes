* Amber(rubber) rubbed onto fur, creates negative charge that allows you to pick up things (same thing with glass and silk, positive charge)
* When you rub glass with silk, you increase the surface area that comes in contact with the glass which will leave more electrons
* Amber or glass rod repels hanging metal bearing
* Transferring repulsive charge to stand with string attacked to it, they will stand up, when you push two stand together they push themselves in
* Charging the needle and the ring, if you charge it with a rod, the needle will be horizontal, when you ground, the needle will go back to being vertical, as the bottom of the needle is heavier
	* Although we don't need to touch the rod with the ring to manipulate, even if we bring it close some of the electric charge will carry through the air, however if we move the rod away, the charge of the ring will go back to neutral
* Spinning two wheel generator in opposite directions, pulling two charges apart(by doing work on them) we create charges, the more well pull them apart, the more we do, the higher the voltage
	* When a hanging ball bearing is next to it, the ball bearing with rock back and fourth and spark against the metal plates (walls)
		*  The ball is a conductor will carry take positive charge from each plate, until it sparks
		*  Positive force experiences the direction of the electric charge
		*  Negative force changes in the opposite direction of the electric charge	
* van der graaf generator, two metal spheres, transferring charge between the two of them, when you bring the small sphere next to the big spear, there will be a spark that discharges the positive charge on the big sphere
	* standing up hair, didnt work too much humidity, the charge just goes out due to the mositure
	* works well with barbie
	* also repels tin plates and rice krispies 
	* Spin a S shaped wire with sharp tips like an electric motor
* electronic air cleaners
	* dust that charges the device?
