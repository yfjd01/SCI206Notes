#Pressure#


Demos

* Ice, water steam
* Balloon in liquid nitrogen (you can fit alot into the box, bc they shrink, the gas turns into the liquid )
* Steam engine (liquid nitrogen, as it is boiling in room temp
* Boiling an closed container attached to a pressure meter
* Ball bearing in glass chamber, when we increase the energy in the chamber it pushes the foam on top higher. Similar to how gas in a box works, more energy, pushes air higher
* Bed of nails, even distribution of pressure
* Suction cup square mat, you can't pull it upwards
* Hydraulic
* How a car jack works (with hydraulic syringes)
* Standing on board with alot of balloons under it
