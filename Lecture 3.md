##Resonance##

To make pulses - move a rope up and down really fast.
The velocity of the rope travels to the right.

Different kinds of waves. 

1. Transverse Oscillations

	Amplitude:
 
	WaveLength: (lambda)


2. Longitudinal Oscillation (sound)

	A wave travelling down a slinky is an example. Pressure is a foce exerted over an area, and  has regions of low and high pressure. 




**Breaking the wine glass**

The edge of the wine glass moved 3/4 millimeters.

**Bell in a glass**

Once the air was sucked out, the sound was no longer being produced.

###Speed of a Wave###
Speed (v) 

Frequency (f) The number of oscillations that occur in a second.

Period (T) The time it takes for one oscillation to occur

Speed of traveling wave = Frequency x Wavelength: V = L x F.

## Doppler Effect##

(Think of ambulance).

Waves get compressed or expanded, as the move farther/ closer to you. Which increases/ decreases the frequency of the sound emitted. 

##Pendulums

Period of pendulum is completely dependent from amplitude.

Usually an experiment is done with a cannonball, where a person pulls it back and lets it swing.
It will never hit the person / gain more energy than it had stored as the gravitational potential energy originally.

##Harmonic Oscillator

##Resonance##
Oscillators have a natural frequency at which they prefer to oscillate.

If energy is applied to the oscillator at the same frequence, the amplitude of the oscillations will increase.

Example: Pushing a child on a swing.

Example: Tacoma Bridge breaks due to wind adding to it's resonant frequency.
