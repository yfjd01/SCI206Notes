* how a rocket works, making high pressure come out in a single direction
* pressurized gas

* propulsion: 
* momentum transfer
* throwing concrete block when on ice, ignoring friction, then your momentum is equal to the mass times the force your on the throwing rock
* You need an oxygen tank in a rocket along with a fuel tank, (or liquid oxygen) the problem is there isn't enough oxygen at higher altitudes


History of Rockets: 

* Sputnik translation: little traveler
	* Sputnik was basically just a transmitter

What actually makes up a rocket

* Things you carry
* Rocket
* Where stuff comes out 
* Steering (wings)

* staging
* What type of fuel
	* Kerosene, liquid hydrogen 
	* DYK that hydrogen is less dense then oxygen?
		* need to allocate more space for hydrogen then oxygen


* Solid Engine
	* can't control the output
	* save space and other controls (TODO:)

* Ion Impulse engine
