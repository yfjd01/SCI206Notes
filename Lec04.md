##Sounds from wine glass##
Rub finger along rim of glass get friction, stick/slip causes rim of wine glass to move

something has to oscillating, its from the cup either Styrofoam or glass, for glass the frequency its much higher.

Size and shape of the glass determines the natural frequency and makes sound louder

Bowl of wine glass moves in and out like a waterballon. moving air back and forth producing a pressure wave SOUND

##Sound from a tube##

Standing waves

* Pressure differences in tube provide a restoring force
* Simple harmonic oscillator
* Fundamental wavelength is twice length of tube
* Air moves in and out at the ends
* Blows air across the bottom of tube
* Adds energy to resonator, coupling complicated

Organ Pipe

* the length of the pipe controls the frequency
	* Short high frequncy
	* Long low frequency 
* the size of the hole also controls the frequency 

Swing circle tube (how it works)

* Air is passing the top which creates pressure to pull air in from the bottom
* the are pulled in from the bottom, bounces off the ridges which creates an frequency
* the length of the tube doesn't affect the frequency, its the velocity 

Transverse oscillation

* Longitudinal (compressed) oscillation 

##Loud Speaker##

Longitudinal wave travels to us. The pressure wave is created by the speaker cone moving back  and forth

2 speakers one giving high pressure, one giving low pressure will result in noise cancellation 


##Record player##
Sound wave travels through the needle, gets amplified through a horn

The heights of the needle determine the frequency of the sound, and the groves will go up and down in elevation 

##Demos 
* Glass harmonica
* Styrofoam cup edge rubbing
* Metal bowl
* Spinning tube
* Slide whistle
* Fire standing wave
* Fire pulling air from cardboard tube
* Demos : Long Metal rod, compressing , rubbing
* 2 Speakers, One pulling air, one is sucking it up (noise canceling) 
* Record player
